				<h2>Context</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Context : </b> Files that suffix with Context in spring are
					implementing <b>BeanFactory</b> and are having special meaning in
					framework. For example <b>FileSystemXmlApplicationContext </b> takes Standalone XML application context, 
					taking the context definition files from the file system or from URLs, interpreting plain paths as 
					relative file system locations ("mydir/myfile.txt") and Standalone XML application context, taking the context definition files 
					from the class path, interpreting plain paths as class path resource names that include the package path (e.g. "mypackage/myresource.txt") and so on.
				</p>
				<P>In earlier example we have already make use of ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and AnnotationConfigApplicationContext now we will see what BeanFactory really means.
				This interface is implemented by objects that hold a number of bean definitions, each uniquely identified by a String name. Depending on the bean definition, 
				the factory will return either an independent instance of a contained object (the Prototype design pattern), or a single shared instance (a superior
				 alternative to the Singleton design pattern, in which the instance is a singleton in the scope of the factory)	</P>
